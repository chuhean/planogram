# Planogram Web App
A simple planogram for user to display FMCG goods on racks. Users are able to specify the size of the goods and racks. Users are then able to drag-and-drop the goods and position them at the desired location on the racks.
An editable scale is located at the bottom corner of the rack display section, so that users are able to know the scale each unit grid represents in actual measurement for that particular planogram.
